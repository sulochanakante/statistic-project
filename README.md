This project gives proper descriptions of data by analyzing the dataset. Based on analysis, this document will explain what problems are encountered in this business as well as solutions for each problem.
Course: Statistical Methods for Decision Making
The project involved drawing inferences from 3 case studies, namely - Wholesale Customer Data (Store Sales), University Survey Data & Manufacturing Shingles Data. The concepts of various measures of Descriptive Statistics, Probability and Probability Distributions, and various Estimation & Hypothesis Testing measures are used to analyze these case studies.

## Skills & Tools Covered
Descriptive Statistics, Probability Estimation, Hypothesis Testing

## Problems:
### 1 Wholesale Customer Analysis.
### 2 Clear Mountain State University (CMSU) Survey.
### 3 Hypothesis Testing for Quality of Shingles.

## Problem 1 - Wholesale Customers Analysis:
A wholesale distributor operating in different regions of Portugal has information on annual spending of several items in their stores across different regions and channels. The data consists of 440 large retailers’ annual spending on 6 different varieties of products in 3 different regions (Lisbon, Oporto, Other) and across different sales channel (Hotel, Retail).

## Data set:
“Wholesale+Customers+Data.csv”

## Problem 2 - Clear Mountain State University (CMSU) Survey:
The Student News Service at Clear Mountain State University (CMSU) has decided to gather data about the undergraduate students that attend CMSU. CMSU creates and distributes a survey of 14 questions and receives responses from 62 undergraduates.

## Data set:
Survey data set

## Problem 3 - Hypothesis Testing for Quality of Shingles:
An important quality characteristic used by the manufacturers of ABC asphalt shingles is the amount of moisture the shingles contain when they are packaged. Customers may feel that they have purchased a product lacking in quality if they find moisture and wet shingles inside the packaging. In some cases, excessive moisture can cause the granules attached to the shingles for texture and coloring purposes to fall off the shingles resulting in appearance problems. To monitor the amount of moisture present, the company conducts moisture tests. A shingle is weighed and then dried. The shingle is then reweighed, and based on the amount of moisture taken out of the product; the pounds of moisture per 100 square feet are calculated. The company would like to show that the mean moisture content is less than 0.35 pounds per 100 square feet.

## Data set:
The file (A & B shingles.csv) includes 36 measurements (in pounds per 100 square feet) for A shingles and 31 for B shingles.
